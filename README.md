# WireGuard Easy REST API

![Build Status](https://github.com/leonovk/wg-rest-api/actions/workflows/ruby.yml/badge.svg)

The easiest way to run WireGuard VPN + REST API

## Features
* REST API for manage WireGuard server
* Easy installation, simple to use.
* List, create, delete, clients.


## Requirements

* A host with a kernel that supports WireGuard (all modern kernels).
* A host with Docker installed.

### 1. Install Docker

If you haven't installed Docker yet, install it by running:

```bash
curl -sSL https://get.docker.com | sh
sudo usermod -aG docker $(whoami)
exit
```

### 2. Build an image from a Dockerfile

clone this repository and build the image from the dockerfile

To run just run the command:

*Instead of 'wg-rest-api', substitute the name of the image that you specified during assembly*

```
  docker run -d \
  -e WG_HOST=<ðŸš¨YOUR_SERVER_IP> \
  -e AUTH_TOKEN=<ðŸš¨YOUR_ADMIN_API_TOKEN> \
  -v ~/.wg-rest:/etc/wireguard \
  -p 51820:51820/udp \
  -p 3000:3000 \
  --cap-add=NET_ADMIN \
  --restart unless-stopped \
  wg-rest-api
```

### Also important

By default, the application runs in single-threaded mode. This is not a solution for heavy loads. You can change this behavior by setting the appropriate environment variables "PUMA_THREADS" and "WORKERS". However, we do not recommend doing this. The application is not thread safe. If you need large loads, it is better to raise several application instances and set up load balancing between them.

## API

All requests are authorized using the bearer token that you specified in variable AUTH_TOKEN!

### GET /clients

Returns an array with all clients on the server

Example response:

```json
[
  {
    "id": 15,
    "server_public_key": "server_public_key",
    "address": "10.8.0.16/24",
    "private_key": "private_key",
    "preshared_key": "preshared_key",
    "allowed_ips": "0.0.0.0/0, ::/0",
    "dns": "1.1.1.1",
    "persistent_keepalive": 0,
    "endpoint": "0.0.0.0:51820",
    "data": {
      "params1": "value1"
    }
  }
]
```

### POST /clients

Creates a new client. The response will be the new client created. You can pass your parameters in the request parameters. They will be in the data field.

Example response:

```json
{
  "id": 15,
  "server_public_key": "server_public_key",
  "address": "10.8.0.16/24",
  "private_key": "private_key",
  "preshared_key": "preshared_key",
  "allowed_ips": "0.0.0.0/0, ::/0",
  "dns": "1.1.1.1",
  "persistent_keepalive": 0,
  "endpoint": "0.0.0.0:51820",
  "data": {
    "params1": "value1"
  }
}
```

### GET /clients/:id

Returns a specific client by his ID. The answer will be similar to the previous one. If the client is not found, a 404 error will be returned.

### DELETE /clients/:id

Deletes a specific one client. If the client is not found, a 404 error will be returned.

### TODO

- [x] Make a fully functional rest api wireguard server
- [ ] Test coverage
- [ ] Implementation of the ability to update clients
- [ ] Make API points to get statistics on clients
