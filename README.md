## Features

* REST API for manage WireGuard server
* Easy installation, simple to use.
* List, create, edit, delete, enable & disable clients.
* Statistics for which clients are connected
* Good test coverage
* Notifications about connections and disconnections via webhooks (beta)

## Requirements

* A host with a kernel that supports WireGuard (all modern kernels).
* A host with Docker installed.

### 1. Install Docker

If you haven't installed Docker yet, install it by running:

```bash
curl -sSL https://get.docker.com | sh
sudo usermod -aG docker $(whoami)
exit
```

### 2. Run WireGuard REST API

To run just run the command:

```
docker run -d \
-e WG_HOST=<ðŸš¨YOUR_SERVER_IP> \
-e AUTH_TOKEN=<ðŸš¨YOUR_ADMIN_API_TOKEN> \
-e ENVIRONMENT=production \
-v ~/.wg-rest:/etc/wireguard \
-p 51820:51820/udp \
-p 3000:3000 \
--cap-add=NET_ADMIN \
--restart unless-stopped \
leonovk/wg-rest-api
```

**If you can't start the container, try entering the command in one line**

***You can see the full list of available environment variables for application configuration [here](https://github.com/leonovk/wg-rest-api/wiki/Settings-you-can-set)***

### Using a hash token for authorization

You can generate a SHA256 hash token from your password and set it to a variable for authorization. This is more secure and will be useful, for example, if you are deploying a project not on your own servers.

Generate hash:

```bash
docker run --rm leonovk/wg-rest-api bin/wgpass password
```

After that, you start the container as usual, but instead of AUTH_TOKEN, you set AUTH_DIGEST_TOKEN to the value you were given.

For example:

```bash
docker run -d \
...
-e AUTH_DIGEST_TOKEN=your_hash \
...
```

As usual, you authorize all your requests by indicating your password in the corresponding request header. *not hash*

### 3. Functionality check

Make a request to the `healthz` care api point in any way convenient for you. For example:

```bash
curl http://YOUR_SERVER_IP:3000/healthz
```

If you received something similar in response, then everything is fine.

```json
{
  "status": "ok",
  "version": "1.8.11"
}
```

### Also important

By default, the application runs in single-threaded mode. This is not a solution for heavy loads. You can change this behavior by setting the appropriate environment variables "PUMA_THREADS" and "WORKERS". However, we do not recommend doing this. The application is not thread safe. If you need large loads, it is better to raise several application instances and set up load balancing between them.

## API

All requests are authorized using the bearer token that you specified in variable AUTH_TOKEN!

### GET /api/clients

Returns an array with all clients on the server

Example response:

```json
[
  {
    "id": 15,
    "server_public_key": "server_public_key",
    "address": "10.8.0.16/24",
    "private_key": "private_key",
    "preshared_key": "preshared_key",
    "enable": true,
    "allowed_ips": "0.0.0.0/0, ::/0",
    "dns": "1.1.1.1",
    "persistent_keepalive": 0,
    "endpoint": "0.0.0.0:51820",
    "last_online": "2024-12-04 11:01:52 +0000",
    "traffic": {
      "received": 123, // bytes
      "sent": 1234 // bytes
    },
    "data": {
      "params1": "value1"
    }
  }
]
```

### POST /api/clients

Creates a new client. The response will be the new client created. You can pass your parameters in the request parameters. They will be in the data field.

Example response:

```json
{
  "id": 15,
  "server_public_key": "server_public_key",
  "address": "10.8.0.16/24",
  "private_key": "private_key",
  "preshared_key": "preshared_key",
  "enable": true,
  "allowed_ips": "0.0.0.0/0, ::/0",
  "dns": "1.1.1.1",
  "persistent_keepalive": 0,
  "endpoint": "0.0.0.0:51820",
  "last_online": "2024-12-04 11:01:52 +0000",
  "traffic": {
    "received": 123, // bytes
    "sent": 1234 // bytes
  },
  "data": {
    "params1": "value1"
  }
}
```

### GET /api/clients/:id

Returns a specific client by his ID. The answer will be similar to the previous one. If the client is not found, a 404 error will be returned. You can also request a QR code or a user-ready config in the form of text

`GET /api/clients/:id?format=qr`

The QR code will be returned as a PNG image.

content_type => image/png

`GET /api/clients/:id?format=conf`

A text with the config for the client will be returned. This config can already be written to a file and used in wireguard.

For example:

```conf
[Interface]
PrivateKey = private_key
Address = address
DNS = dns

[Peer]
PublicKey = server_public_key
PresharedKey = preshared_key
AllowedIPs = allowed_ips
PersistentKeepalive = persistent_keepalive
Endpoint = endpoint
```

content_type => text/plain

### DELETE /api/clients/:id

Deletes a specific one client. If the client is not found, a 404 error will be returned.

### PATCH /api/clients/:id

Allows you to update specific clients by assigning them new fields. Returns the updated client in response.

Example request:

```json
{
  "address": "string",
  "private_key": "string",
  "public_key": "string",
  "preshared_key": "string",
  "enable": false, // bool
  "data": {} // object
}
```

The enable parameter allows you to enable or disable the client without removing it from the server.

If you update the data field, it will be updated by merging, but if you intentionally send an empty object, then the data will be completely overwritten.

## Development

```

Run app:

```bash
$ puma config.ru
```

Or:

```bash
$ rake start
```

### Run with docker

Build image:

```bash
$ docker build . -t wg-rest-api
